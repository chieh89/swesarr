    "fast neutrons once they penetrate the atmosphere and interact with atmospheric nuclei. Additional\n",
    "neutrons are generated when the cosmic rays interact with the land surface. The produced fast\n",
    "neutrons collide with other atoms in the air and soil, but only if they collide with H atoms, they lose\n",
    "their kinetic energy efficiently as they are similar in mass. As H atoms in the land surface are\n",
    "mostly present in the form of soil moisture, the fast neutron intensity above the land surface is\n",
