This example run is from Jinemi Pan's github repo:

https://github.com/jinmeipan/MCMC_Active

It is from: Active_Real_0.5_Mv&Sig_together/sd1

That is the output from one of the snowpit results from her paper https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/18/139/2024/

the orig-out folder has the outputs originally from Jinmei on her githib.
